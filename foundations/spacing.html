<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<span class="heading-border"></span>

<p>The Assembly Design Language encourages consistency across platforms and screen sizes by using uniform elements and spacing. This helps our customers move between devices without having to relearn the application each time.</p>

<p>By using our standard spacing, the user interface remains consistent, can be scaled easily, and uses rhythm to align elements correctly.</p>

<p>We utilize an 8px &ldquo;soft grid&rdquo; for base spacing and element sizes. We make an exception for using 4px as a half unit only. The below spacing increments apply to both horizontal and vertical spacing between elements.</p>

<p>It is important to use these spacing sizes as they are prescribed, and not to combine them. For example, 36px (combining 32px and 4px) should not be a measurement in our app. Furthermore, 56px should also not be used even though it is divisible by 8px. Instead us a standard spacing size from the sample below.</p>
